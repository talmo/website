This has opened up a new field of computational ethology, and will in the near future make it possible to quantify in near completeness what an animal is doing as it navigates its environment. The importance of improving the techniques with which we characterize behavior is reflected in the emerging recognition that understanding behavior is an essential (or even pre-requisite) step to pursuing neuroscience questions. The use of these methods, however, is not limited to studying behavior in the wild or in strictly ethological settings. The modern tools for behavioral quantification can be applied to the full gamut of approaches that have historically been used to link brain to behavior, from psychophysics to cognitive tasks, augmenting those measurements with rich descriptions of how animals navigate those tasks. Here we review recent technical advances in quantifying behavior, particularly in methods for tracking animal motion and characterizing the structure of those dynamics. We discuss open challenges that remain for behavioral quantification and highlight promising future directions - with a strong emphasis on emerging approaches in deep learning, the core technology that has enabled the markedly rapid pace of progress of this field. We then discuss how quantitative descriptions of behavior can be leveraged to connect brain activity with animal movements, with the ultimate goal of resolving the relationship between neural circuits, cognitive processes, and behavior.","tags":[],"title":"Quantifying behavior to understand the brain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Talmo D Pereira","Nathaniel Tabris","Junyu Li","Shruthi Ravindranath","Eleni S Papadoyannis","Z Yan Wang","David M Turner","Grace McKenzie-Smith","Sarah D Kocher","Annegret Lea Falkner","Joshua W Shaevitz","Mala Murthy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602522704,"objectID":"535642b737a10d86fa04a67a6bb4a37a","permalink":"/publication/pereira-2020-tt/","publishdate":"2020-10-12T17:11:43.706219Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pereira-2020-tt/","section":"publication","summary":"The desire to understand how the brain generates and patterns behavior has driven rapid methodological innovation to quantify and model natural animal behavior.

Helmet NIV has seen an increase in use during the COVID-19 pandemic because it is low-cost, readily available, and provides viral filters between the patient and clinician. Helmet NIV may also provide better patient outcomes by delaying or eliminating the need for invasive ventilation. Its widespread adoption has been limited, however, by the lack of a respiratory monitoring system that is needed to address known safety vulnerabilities and to provide clinicians with a respiratory profile of the patient. To address this safety need, we have developed an inexpensive respiratory monitoring system that is based on readily available commercial components and is suitable for rapid local manufacture. The system is designed for use in conjunction with the COVID-19 Helmet developed by Sea-Long Medical Systems, but is modular and can be used with other ventilation systems. The monitoring system comprises one or more flow and pressure sensors and a central remote station that can be used to remotely monitor up to 20 patients simultaneously. The system reports flow, pressure, and clinically relevant metrics including respiratory rate, tidal volume equivalent, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the ratio of inspiratory time to expiratory time (I:E). The device will sound alarms based on clinician-set thresholds. In bench tests using a commercial ventilator and artificial lung system, our device performs comparably to a commercial single-patient respiratory monitor. Results are presented from human-subject tests on a healthy volunteer undergoing helmet non-invasive ventilation.

Here, we focus on changes in the behavioral state of Drosophila females that persist for minutes following optogenetic activation of a single class of central brain neurons termed pC1. We find that female pC1 neurons drive a variety of persistent behaviors in the presence of males, including increased receptivity, shoving, and chasing. By reconstructing cells in a volume electron microscopic image of the female brain, we classify 7 different pC1 cell types and, using cell type specific driver lines, determine that one of these, pC1-Alpha, is responsible for driving persistent female shoving and chasing. Using calcium imaging, we locate sites of minutes-long persistent neural activity in the brain, which include pC1 neurons themselves. Finally, we exhaustively reconstruct all synaptic partners of a single pC1-Alpha neuron, and find recurrent connectivity that could support the persistent neural activity. Our work thus links minutes-long persistent changes in behavior with persistent neural activity and recurrent circuit architecture in the female brain.","tags":[],"title":"The Neural Basis for a Persistent Internal State in Drosophila Females","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Talmo D Pereira","Diego E Aldarondo","Lindsay Willmore","Mikhail Kislin","Samuel S-H Wang","Mala Murthy","Joshua W Shaevitz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602522701,"objectID":"8869bc8e5bc8da55985fbdb345f9d38c","permalink":"/publication/pereira-2019-vg/","publishdate":"2020-10-12T17:11:40.714904Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pereira-2019-vg/","section":"publication","summary":"The need for automated and efficient systems for tracking full animal pose has increased with the complexity of behavioral data and analyses.

If distinct behaviors are lumped together, separate modes of brain activity can be wrongly attributed to the same behavior. Alternatively, if a single behavior is split into two, the same neural activity can appear to produce different behaviors. Here, we address this issue in the context of acoustic communication in Drosophila. During courtship, males vibrate their wings to generate time-varying songs, and females evaluate songs to inform mating decisions. For 50 years, Drosophila melanogaster song was thought to consist of only two modes, sine and pulse, but using unsupervised classification methods on large datasets of song recordings, we now establish the existence of at least three song modes: two distinct pulse types, along with a single sine mode. We show how this seemingly subtle distinction affects our interpretation of the mechanisms underlying song production and perception. Specifically, we show that visual feedback influences the probability of producing each song mode and that male song mode choice affects female responses and contributes to modulating his song amplitude with distance. At the neural level, we demonstrate how the activity of four separate neuron types within the fly's song pathway differentially affects the probability of producing each song mode. Our results highlight the importance of carefully segmenting behavior to map the underlying sensory, neural, and genetic mechanisms.","tags":["\"Drosophila; acoustic communication; behavior; courtship song; neural circuits\""],"title":"Discovery of a New Song Mode in Drosophila Reveals Hidden Structure in the Sensory and Neural Drivers of Behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gecia Bravo Hermsdorff","Talmo Pereira","Yael Niv"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602522700,"objectID":"51848b769e0fa4e094a64ca0f7e3eaad","permalink":"/publication/hermsdorff-2018-bn/","publishdate":"2020-10-12T17:11:40.098707Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hermsdorff-2018-bn/","section":"publication","summary":"Some new tasks are trivial to learn while others are almost impossible; what determines how easy it is to learn an arbitrary task? Similar to how our prior beliefs about new visual scenes colors our perception of new stimuli, our priors about the structure of new tasks shapes our learning and generalization abilities [2]. While quantifying visual priors has led to major insights on how our visual system works [5, 10, 11], quantifying priors over tasks remains a formidable goal, as it is not even clear how to define a task [4]. Here, we focus on tasks that have a natural mapping to graphs. We develop a method to quantify humans' priors over these \"task graphs\", combining new modeling approaches with Markov chain Monte Carlo with people, MCMCP (a process whereby an agent learns from data generated by another agent, recursively [9]). We show that our method recovers priors more accurately than a standard MCMC sampling approach. Additionally, we propose a novel low-dimensional \"smooth\" (In the sense that graphs that differ by fewer edges are given similar probabilities.) parametrization of probability distributions over graphs that allows for more accurate recovery of the prior and better generalization. We have also created an online experiment platform that gamifies our MCMCP algorithm and allows subjects to interactively draw the task graphs. We use this platform to collect human data on several navigation and social interactions tasks. We show that priors over these tasks have non-trivial structure, deviating significantly from null models that are insensitive to the graphical information. The priors also notably differ between the navigation and social domains, showing fewer differences between cover stories within the same domain. Finally, we extend our framework to the more general case of quantifying priors over exchangeable random structures.","tags":[],"title":"Quantifying Humans' Priors Over Graphical Representations of Tasks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Giovannucci","E A Pnevmatikakis","B Deverett","T Pereira","J Fondriest","M J Brady","S S-H Wang","W Abbas","P Parés","D Masip"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602522698,"objectID":"8f4c27de4a50b04e481d78a31b30ec2e","permalink":"/publication/giovannucci-2018-vb/","publishdate":"2020-10-12T17:11:37.736318Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giovannucci-2018-vb/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: The preparation consisting of a head-fixed mouse on a spherical or cylindrical treadmill offers unique advantages in a variety of experimental contexts.

Recently, we have shown that metagenomics datasets can be leveraged to characterize population-wide transcriptional regulatory networks, or meta-regulons, providing insights into how bacterial populations respond collectively to specific triggers. Here we formalize a Bayesian inference framework to analyze the composition of transcriptional regulatory networks in metagenomes by determining the probability of regulation of orthologous gene sequences. We assess the performance of this approach on synthetic datasets and we validate it by analyzing the copper-homeostasis network of Firmicutes species in the human gut microbiome. RESULTS: Assessment on synthetic datasets shows that our method provides a robust and interpretable metric for assessing putative regulation by a transcription factor on sets of promoter sequences mapping to an orthologous gene cluster. The inference framework integrates the regulatory contribution of secondary sites and can discern false positives arising from multiple instances of a clonal sequence. Posterior probabilities for orthologous gene clusters decline sharply when less than 20 % of mapped promoters have binding sites, but we introduce a sensitivity adjustment procedure to speed up computation that enhances regulation assessment in heterogeneous ortholog clusters. Analysis of the copper-homeostasis regulon governed by CsoR in the human gut microbiome Firmicutes reveals that CsoR controls itself and copper-translocating P-type ATPases, but not CopZ-type copper chaperones. Our analysis also indicates that CsoR frequently targets promoters with dual CsoR-binding sites, suggesting that it exploits higher-order binding conformations to fine-tune its activity. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce and validate a method for the analysis of transcriptional regulatory networks from metagenomic data that enables inference of meta-regulons in a systematic and interpretable way. Validation of this method on the CsoR meta-regulon of gut microbiome Firmicutes illustrates the usefulness of the approach, revealing novel properties of the copper-homeostasis network in poorly characterized bacterial species and putting forward evidence of new mechanisms of DNA binding for this transcriptional regulator.
