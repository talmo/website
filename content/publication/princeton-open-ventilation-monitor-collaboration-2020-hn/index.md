abstract: Helmet non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a form of continuous positive applied
  pressure that has emerged as a useful therapy for COVID-19 patients who require
  respiratory support but may not require invasive ventilation. Helmet NIV has seen
  an increase in use during the COVID-19 pandemic because it is low-cost, readily
  available, and provides viral filters between the patient and clinician. Helmet
  NIV may also provide better patient outcomes by delaying or eliminating the need
  for invasive ventilation. Its widespread adoption has been limited, however, by
  the lack of a respiratory monitoring system that is needed to address known safety
  vulnerabilities and to provide clinicians with a respiratory profile of the patient.
  To address this safety need, we have developed an inexpensive respiratory monitoring
  system that is based on readily available commercial components and is suitable
  for rapid local manufacture. The system is designed for use in conjunction with
  the COVID-19 Helmet developed by Sea-Long Medical Systems, but is modular and can
  be used with other ventilation systems. The monitoring system comprises one or more
  flow and pressure sensors and a central remote station that can be used to remotely
  monitor up to 20 patients simultaneously. The system reports flow, pressure, and
  clinically relevant metrics including respiratory rate, tidal volume equivalent,
  peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the
  ratio of inspiratory time to expiratory time (I:E). The device will sound alarms
  based on clinician-set thresholds. In bench tests using a commercial ventilator
  and artificial lung system, our device performs comparably to a commercial single-patient
  respiratory monitor. Results are presented from human-subject tests on a healthy
  volunteer undergoing helmet non-invasive ventilation. Detailed design and manufacturing
  documents are provided.
