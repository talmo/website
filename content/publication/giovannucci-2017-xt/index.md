abstract: Cerebellar granule cells, which constitute half the brain's neurons, supply
  Purkinje cells with contextual information necessary for motor learning, but how
  they encode this information is unknown. Here we show, using two-photon microscopy
  to track neural activity over multiple days of cerebellum-dependent eyeblink conditioning
  in mice, that granule cell populations acquire a dense representation of the anticipatory
  eyelid movement. Initially, granule cells responded to neutral visual and somatosensory
  stimuli as well as periorbital airpuffs used for training. As learning progressed,
  two-thirds of monitored granule cells acquired a conditional response whose timing
  matched or preceded the learned eyelid movements. Granule cell activity covaried
  trial by trial to form a redundant code. Many granule cells were also active during
  movements of nearby body structures. Thus, a predictive signal about the upcoming
  movement is widely available at the input stage of the cerebellar cortex, as required
  by forward models of cerebellar control.
