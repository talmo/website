abstract: Cognitive and social capacities require postnatal experience, yet the pathways
  by which experience guides development are unknown. Here we show that the normal
  development of motor and nonmotor capacities requires cerebellar activity. Using
  chemogenetic perturbation of molecular layer interneurons to attenuate cerebellar
  output in mice, we found that activity of posterior regions in juvenile life modulates
  adult expression of eyeblink conditioning (paravermal lobule VI, crus I), reversal
  learning (lobule VI), persistive behavior and novelty-seeking (lobule VII), and
  social preference (crus I/II). Perturbation in adult life altered only a subset
  of phenotypes. Both adult and juvenile disruption left gait metrics largely unaffected.
  Contributions to phenotypes increased with the amount of lobule inactivated. Using
  an anterograde transsynaptic tracer, we found that posterior cerebellum made strong
  connections with prelimbic, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortex. These
  findings provide anatomical substrates for the clinical observation that cerebellar
  injury increases the risk of autism.
