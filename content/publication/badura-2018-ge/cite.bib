 abstract = {Cognitive and social capacities require postnatal experience, yet
the pathways by which experience guides development are unknown.
Here we show that the normal development of motor and nonmotor
capacities requires cerebellar activity. Using chemogenetic
perturbation of molecular layer interneurons to attenuate
cerebellar output in mice, we found that activity of posterior
regions in juvenile life modulates adult expression of eyeblink
conditioning (paravermal lobule VI, crus I), reversal learning
(lobule VI), persistive behavior and novelty-seeking (lobule
VII), and social preference (crus I/II). Perturbation in adult
life altered only a subset of phenotypes. Both adult and juvenile
disruption left gait metrics largely unaffected. Contributions to
phenotypes increased with the amount of lobule inactivated. Using
an anterograde transsynaptic tracer, we found that posterior
cerebellum made strong connections with prelimbic, orbitofrontal,
and anterior cingulate cortex. These findings provide anatomical
substrates for the clinical observation that cerebellar injury
increases the risk of autism.},
