abstract: Objective and automatic measurement of pain in mice remains a barrier for
  discovery in neuroscience. Here, we capture paw kinematics during pain behavior
  in mice with high-speed videography and automated paw tracking with machine and
  deep learning approaches. Our statistical software platform, PAWS (Pain Assessment
  at Withdrawal Speeds), uses a univariate projection of paw position over time to
  automatically quantify seven behavioral features that are combined into a single,
  univariate pain score. Automated paw tracking combined with PAWS reveals a behaviorally
  divergent mouse strain that displays hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli. To
  demonstrate the efficacy of PAWS for detecting spinally versus centrally mediated
  behavioral responses, we chemogenetically activated nociceptive neurons in the amygdala,
  which further separated the pain-related behavioral features and the resulting pain
  score. Taken together, this automated pain quantification approach will increase
  objectivity in collecting rigorous behavioral data, and it is compatible with other
  neural circuit dissection tools for determining the mouse pain state.
