 abstract = {Objective and automatic measurement of pain in mice remains a
barrier for discovery in neuroscience. Here, we capture paw
kinematics during pain behavior in mice with high-speed
videography and automated paw tracking with machine and deep
learning approaches. Our statistical software platform, PAWS
(Pain Assessment at Withdrawal Speeds), uses a univariate
projection of paw position over time to automatically quantify
seven behavioral features that are combined into a single,
univariate pain score. Automated paw tracking combined with PAWS
reveals a behaviorally divergent mouse strain that displays
hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli. To demonstrate the
efficacy of PAWS for detecting spinally versus centrally mediated
behavioral responses, we chemogenetically activated nociceptive
neurons in the amygdala, which further separated the pain-related
behavioral features and the resulting pain score. Taken together,
this automated pain quantification approach will increase
objectivity in collecting rigorous behavioral data, and it is
compatible with other neural circuit dissection tools for
determining the mouse pain state.},
