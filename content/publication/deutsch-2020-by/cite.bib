 abstract = {Abstract Sustained changes in mood or action require persistent
changes in neural activity, but it has been difficult to identify
and characterize the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie
persistent activity and contribute to long-lasting changes in
behavior. Here, we focus on changes in the behavioral state of
Drosophila females that persist for minutes following optogenetic
activation of a single class of central brain neurons termed pC1.
We find that female pC1 neurons drive a variety of persistent
behaviors in the presence of males, including increased
receptivity, shoving, and chasing. By reconstructing cells in a
volume electron microscopic image of the female brain, we
classify 7 different pC1 cell types and, using cell type specific
driver lines, determine that one of these, pC1-Alpha, is
responsible for driving persistent female shoving and chasing.
Using calcium imaging, we locate sites of minutes-long persistent
neural activity in the brain, which include pC1 neurons
themselves. Finally, we exhaustively reconstruct all synaptic
partners of a single pC1-Alpha neuron, and find recurrent
connectivity that could support the persistent neural activity.
Our work thus links minutes-long persistent changes in behavior
with persistent neural activity and recurrent circuit
architecture in the female brain.},
