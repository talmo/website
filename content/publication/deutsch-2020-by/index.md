abstract: Abstract Sustained changes in mood or action require persistent changes
  in neural activity, but it has been difficult to identify and characterize the neural
  circuit mechanisms that underlie persistent activity and contribute to long-lasting
  changes in behavior. Here, we focus on changes in the behavioral state of Drosophila
  females that persist for minutes following optogenetic activation of a single class
  of central brain neurons termed pC1. We find that female pC1 neurons drive a variety
  of persistent behaviors in the presence of males, including increased receptivity,
  shoving, and chasing. By reconstructing cells in a volume electron microscopic image
  of the female brain, we classify 7 different pC1 cell types and, using cell type
  specific driver lines, determine that one of these, pC1-Alpha, is responsible for
  driving persistent female shoving and chasing. Using calcium imaging, we locate
  sites of minutes-long persistent neural activity in the brain, which include pC1
  neurons themselves. Finally, we exhaustively reconstruct all synaptic partners of
  a single pC1-Alpha neuron, and find recurrent connectivity that could support the
  persistent neural activity. Our work thus links minutes-long persistent changes
  in behavior with persistent neural activity and recurrent circuit architecture in
  the female brain.
