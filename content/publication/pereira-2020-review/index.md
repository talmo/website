abstract: 'Over the past years, numerous methods have emerged to automate the 
              quantification of animal behavior at a resolution not previously 
              imaginable. This has opened up a new field of computational 
              ethology, and will in the near future make it possible to 
              quantify in near completeness what an animal is doing as it 
              navigates its environment. The importance of improving the 
              techniques with which we characterize behavior is reflected in 
              the emerging recognition that understanding behavior is an 
              essential (or even pre-requisite) step to pursuing neuroscience 
              questions. The use of these methods, however, is not limited to 
              studying behavior in the wild or in strictly ethological 
              settings. The modern tools for behavioral quantification can be 
              applied to the full gamut of approaches that have historically 
              been used to link brain to behavior, from psychophysics to 
              cognitive tasks, augmenting those measurements with rich 
              descriptions of how animals navigate those tasks. Here we review 
              recent technical advances in quantifying behavior, particularly 
              in methods for tracking animal motion and characterizing the 
              structure of those dynamics. We discuss open challenges that 
              remain for behavioral quantification and highlight promising 
              future directions - with a strong emphasis on emerging 
              approaches in deep learning, the core technology that has 
              enabled the markedly rapid pace of progress of this field. We 
              then discuss how quantitative descriptions of behavior can be 
              leveraged to connect brain activity with animal movements, with 
              the ultimate goal of resolving the relationship between neural 
              circuits, cognitive processes, and behavior.'
