 abstract = {Deciphering how brains generate behavior depends critically on an
accurate description of behavior. If distinct behaviors are
lumped together, separate modes of brain activity can be wrongly
attributed to the same behavior. Alternatively, if a single
behavior is split into two, the same neural activity can appear
to produce different behaviors. Here, we address this issue in
the context of acoustic communication in Drosophila. During
courtship, males vibrate their wings to generate time-varying
songs, and females evaluate songs to inform mating decisions. For
50 years, Drosophila melanogaster song was thought to consist of
only two modes, sine and pulse, but using unsupervised
classification methods on large datasets of song recordings, we
now establish the existence of at least three song modes: two
distinct pulse types, along with a single sine mode. We show how
this seemingly subtle distinction affects our interpretation of
the mechanisms underlying song production and perception.
Specifically, we show that visual feedback influences the
probability of producing each song mode and that male song mode
choice affects female responses and contributes to modulating his
song amplitude with distance. At the neural level, we demonstrate
how the activity of four separate neuron types within the fly's
song pathway differentially affects the probability of producing
each song mode. Our results highlight the importance of carefully
segmenting behavior to map the underlying sensory, neural, and
genetic mechanisms.},
