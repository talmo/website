abstract: "Deciphering how brains generate behavior depends critically on an accurate\
  \ description of behavior. If distinct behaviors are lumped together, separate modes\
  \ of brain activity can be wrongly attributed to the same behavior. Alternatively,\
  \ if a single behavior is split into two, the same neural activity can appear to\
  \ produce different behaviors. Here, we address this issue in the context of acoustic\
  \ communication in Drosophila. During courtship, males vibrate their wings to generate\
  \ time-varying songs, and females evaluate songs to inform mating decisions. For\
  \ 50 years, Drosophila melanogaster song was thought to consist of only two modes,\
  \ sine and pulse, but using unsupervised classification methods on large datasets\
  \ of song recordings, we now establish the existence of at least three song modes:\
  \ two distinct pulse types, along with a single sine mode. We show how this seemingly\
  \ subtle distinction affects our interpretation of the mechanisms underlying song\
  \ production and perception. Specifically, we show that visual feedback influences\
  \ the probability of producing each song mode and that male song mode choice affects\
  \ female responses and contributes to modulating his song amplitude with distance.\
  \ At the neural level, we demonstrate how the activity of four separate neuron types\
  \ within the fly's song pathway differentially affects the probability of producing\
  \ each song mode. Our results highlight the importance of carefully segmenting behavior\
  \ to map the underlying sensory, neural, and genetic mechanisms."
