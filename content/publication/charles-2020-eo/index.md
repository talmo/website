abstract: As acquiring bigger data becomes easier in experimental brain science, computational
  and statistical brain science must achieve similar advances to fully capitalize
  on these data. Tackling these problems will benefit from a more explicit and concerted
  effort to work together. Specifically, brain science can be further democratized
  by harnessing the power of community-driven tools, which both are built by and benefit
  from many different people with different backgrounds and expertise. This perspective
  can be applied across modalities and scales and enables collaborations across previously
  siloed communities.
