 abstract = {As acquiring bigger data becomes easier in experimental brain
science, computational and statistical brain science must achieve
similar advances to fully capitalize on these data. Tackling
these problems will benefit from a more explicit and concerted
effort to work together. Specifically, brain science can be
further democratized by harnessing the power of community-driven
tools, which both are built by and benefit from many different
people with different backgrounds and expertise. This perspective
can be applied across modalities and scales and enables
collaborations across previously siloed communities.},
