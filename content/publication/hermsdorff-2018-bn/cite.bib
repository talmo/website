 abstract = {Some new tasks are trivial to learn while others are almost
impossible; what determines how easy it is to learn an arbitrary
task? Similar to how our prior beliefs about new visual scenes
colors our perception of new stimuli, our priors about the
structure of new tasks shapes our learning and generalization
abilities [2]. While quantifying visual priors has led to major
insights on how our visual system works [5, 10, 11], quantifying
priors over tasks remains a formidable goal, as it is not even
clear how to define a task [4]. Here, we focus on tasks that
have a natural mapping to graphs. We develop a method to
quantify humans' priors over these ``task graphs'', combining
new modeling approaches with Markov chain Monte Carlo with
people, MCMCP (a process whereby an agent learns from data
generated by another agent, recursively [9]). We show that our
method recovers priors more accurately than a standard MCMC
sampling approach. Additionally, we propose a novel
low-dimensional ``smooth'' (In the sense that graphs that differ
by fewer edges are given similar probabilities.) parametrization
of probability distributions over graphs that allows for more
accurate recovery of the prior and better generalization. We
have also created an online experiment platform that gamifies
our MCMCP algorithm and allows subjects to interactively draw
the task graphs. We use this platform to collect human data on
several navigation and social interactions tasks. We show that
priors over these tasks have non-trivial structure, deviating
significantly from null models that are insensitive to the
graphical information. The priors also notably differ between
the navigation and social domains, showing fewer differences
between cover stories within the same domain. Finally, we extend
our framework to the more general case of quantifying priors
over exchangeable random structures.},
