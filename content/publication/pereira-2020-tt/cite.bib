 abstract = {The desire to understand how the brain generates and patterns
behavior has driven rapid methodological innovation to quantify
and model natural animal behavior. This has led to important
advances in deep learning-based markerless pose estimation that
have been enabled in part by the success of deep learning for
computer vision applications. Here we present SLEAP (Social LEAP
Estimates Animal Poses), a framework for multi-animal pose
tracking via deep learning. This system is capable of
simultaneously tracking any number of animals during social
interactions and across a variety of experimental conditions.
SLEAP implements several complementary approaches for dealing
with the problems inherent in moving from single- to multi-animal
pose tracking, including configurable neural network
architectures, inference techniques, and tracking algorithms,
enabling easy specialization and tuning for particular
experimental conditions or performance requirements. We report
results on multiple datasets of socially interacting animals
(flies, bees, and mice) and describe how dataset-specific
properties can be leveraged to determine the best configuration
of SLEAP models. Using a high accuracy model (<2.8 px error on
95% of points), we were able to track two animals from full size
1024 x 1024 pixel frames at up to 320 FPS. The SLEAP framework
comes with a sophisticated graphical user interface,
multi-platform support, Colab-based GPU-free training and
inference, and complete tutorials available, in addition to the
datasets, at sleap.ai. ### Competing Interest Statement The
