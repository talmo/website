abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The preparation consisting of a head-fixed mouse on a spherical
  or cylindrical treadmill offers unique advantages in a variety of experimental contexts.
  Head fixation provides the mechanical stability necessary for optical and electrophysiological
  recordings and stimulation. Additionally, it can be combined with virtual environments
  such as T-mazes, enabling these types of recording during diverse behaviors. NEW
  METHOD: In this paper we present a low-cost, easy-to-build acquisition system, along
  with scalable computational methods to quantitatively measure behavior (locomotion
  and paws, whiskers, and tail motion patterns) in head-fixed mice locomoting on cylindrical
  or spherical treadmills. EXISTING METHODS: Several custom supervised and unsupervised
  methods have been developed for measuring behavior in mice. However, to date there
  is no low-cost, turn-key, general-purpose, and scalable system for acquiring and
  quantifying behavior in mice. RESULTS: We benchmark our algorithms against ground
  truth data generated either by manual labeling or by simpler methods of feature
  extraction. We demonstrate that our algorithms achieve good performance, both in
  supervised and unsupervised settings. CONCLUSIONS: We present a low-cost suite of
  tools for behavioral quantification, which serve as valuable complements to recording
  and stimulation technologies being developed for the head-fixed mouse preparation.'
