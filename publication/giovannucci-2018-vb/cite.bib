 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The preparation consisting of a head-fixed mouse on a
spherical or cylindrical treadmill offers unique advantages in a
variety of experimental contexts. Head fixation provides the
mechanical stability necessary for optical and
electrophysiological recordings and stimulation. Additionally, it
can be combined with virtual environments such as T-mazes,
enabling these types of recording during diverse behaviors. NEW
METHOD: In this paper we present a low-cost, easy-to-build
acquisition system, along with scalable computational methods to
quantitatively measure behavior (locomotion and paws, whiskers,
and tail motion patterns) in head-fixed mice locomoting on
cylindrical or spherical treadmills. EXISTING METHODS: Several
custom supervised and unsupervised methods have been developed
for measuring behavior in mice. However, to date there is no
low-cost, turn-key, general-purpose, and scalable system for
acquiring and quantifying behavior in mice. RESULTS: We benchmark
our algorithms against ground truth data generated either by
manual labeling or by simpler methods of feature extraction. We
demonstrate that our algorithms achieve good performance, both in
supervised and unsupervised settings. CONCLUSIONS: We present a
low-cost suite of tools for behavioral quantification, which
serve as valuable complements to recording and stimulation
technologies being developed for the head-fixed mouse
preparation.},
