 abstract = {Helmet non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a form of continuous
positive applied pressure that has emerged as a useful therapy
for COVID-19 patients who require respiratory support but may
not require invasive ventilation. Helmet NIV has seen an
increase in use during the COVID-19 pandemic because it is
low-cost, readily available, and provides viral filters
between the patient and clinician. Helmet NIV may also provide
better patient outcomes by delaying or eliminating the need
for invasive ventilation. Its widespread adoption has been
limited, however, by the lack of a respiratory monitoring
system that is needed to address known safety vulnerabilities
and to provide clinicians with a respiratory profile of the
patient. To address this safety need, we have developed an
inexpensive respiratory monitoring system that is based on
readily available commercial components and is suitable for
rapid local manufacture. The system is designed for use in
conjunction with the COVID-19 Helmet developed by Sea-Long
Medical Systems, but is modular and can be used with other
ventilation systems. The monitoring system comprises one or
more flow and pressure sensors and a central remote station
that can be used to remotely monitor up to 20 patients
simultaneously. The system reports flow, pressure, and
clinically relevant metrics including respiratory rate, tidal
volume equivalent, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the ratio of inspiratory
time to expiratory time (I:E). The device will sound alarms
based on clinician-set thresholds. In bench tests using a
commercial ventilator and artificial lung system, our device
performs comparably to a commercial single-patient respiratory
monitor. Results are presented from human-subject tests on a
healthy volunteer undergoing helmet non-invasive ventilation.
