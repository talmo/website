 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metagenomics enables the analysis of bacterial
population composition and the study of emergent population
features, such as shared metabolic pathways. Recently, we have
shown that metagenomics datasets can be leveraged to characterize
population-wide transcriptional regulatory networks, or
meta-regulons, providing insights into how bacterial populations
respond collectively to specific triggers. Here we formalize a
Bayesian inference framework to analyze the composition of
transcriptional regulatory networks in metagenomes by determining
the probability of regulation of orthologous gene sequences. We
assess the performance of this approach on synthetic datasets and
we validate it by analyzing the copper-homeostasis network of
Firmicutes species in the human gut microbiome. RESULTS:
Assessment on synthetic datasets shows that our method provides a
robust and interpretable metric for assessing putative regulation
by a transcription factor on sets of promoter sequences mapping
to an orthologous gene cluster. The inference framework
integrates the regulatory contribution of secondary sites and can
discern false positives arising from multiple instances of a
clonal sequence. Posterior probabilities for orthologous gene
clusters decline sharply when less than 20 % of mapped promoters
have binding sites, but we introduce a sensitivity adjustment
procedure to speed up computation that enhances regulation
assessment in heterogeneous ortholog clusters. Analysis of the
copper-homeostasis regulon governed by CsoR in the human gut
microbiome Firmicutes reveals that CsoR controls itself and
copper-translocating P-type ATPases, but not CopZ-type copper
chaperones. Our analysis also indicates that CsoR frequently
targets promoters with dual CsoR-binding sites, suggesting that
it exploits higher-order binding conformations to fine-tune its
activity. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce and validate a method for the
analysis of transcriptional regulatory networks from metagenomic
data that enables inference of meta-regulons in a systematic and
interpretable way. Validation of this method on the CsoR
meta-regulon of gut microbiome Firmicutes illustrates the
usefulness of the approach, revealing novel properties of the
copper-homeostasis network in poorly characterized bacterial
species and putting forward evidence of new mechanisms of DNA
binding for this transcriptional regulator. Our approach will
enable the comparative analysis of regulatory networks across
metagenomes, yielding novel insights into the evolution of
transcriptional regulatory networks.},
