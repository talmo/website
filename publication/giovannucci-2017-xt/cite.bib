 abstract = {Cerebellar granule cells, which constitute half the brain's
neurons, supply Purkinje cells with contextual information
necessary for motor learning, but how they encode this
information is unknown. Here we show, using two-photon microscopy
to track neural activity over multiple days of
cerebellum-dependent eyeblink conditioning in mice, that granule
cell populations acquire a dense representation of the
anticipatory eyelid movement. Initially, granule cells responded
to neutral visual and somatosensory stimuli as well as
periorbital airpuffs used for training. As learning progressed,
two-thirds of monitored granule cells acquired a conditional
response whose timing matched or preceded the learned eyelid
movements. Granule cell activity covaried trial by trial to form
a redundant code. Many granule cells were also active during
movements of nearby body structures. Thus, a predictive signal
about the upcoming movement is widely available at the input
stage of the cerebellar cortex, as required by forward models of
cerebellar control.},
